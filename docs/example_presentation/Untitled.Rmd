# Here you can place global options for the entire document.
# Mostly used for knitr settings, but can also load data etc.

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Heading 1
There are several heading levels. 

## Heading 2
depending on your hierarchy

maybe some latex math? 
$$\large x = \frac{y}{z} $$

And some **bold** and  _italics_ text? 


## Add some R code
```{r}
library(lcbcr)
library(ggplot2)
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = disp, colour = cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_lcbc()
```
